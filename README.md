##Project Title: How have the last 5 years of board game production changed from prior years?
#Team Members: Max Browning & Zach Gibbs
#Project Description & Outline: Using Board Game Atlas, a popular forum for rating games and connecting with other gamers, we will look into board game trends over the last five years and see how those compare to prior years.

##Defining Variables:
#Mechanics - The style of game play by the playersâ€™ prominent action, such as dice rolling or deck building.
#Themes - The subject and setting of the board game, such as zombies or island exploration.
#Player Counts - The number of players who participate in the game at the same time.

##Research Questions to Answer:
	#- How have mechanics changed?
	#- How have themes changed?
	#- Have player counts shifted considerably?
	#- Are these trends shared across the top publishers in board gaming?

##Datasets to Be Used:
#Board Game Atlas API

##Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
#Pull data from API
#Clean data and group by release date
#Breakdown mechanics, theme, and player count data
#Create summary data frames for each
#Create charts showing trends over time
#Pull data for top publishers
#Compare their last five years with last five years
#Charts / Summary Tables - whichever better fits the data
